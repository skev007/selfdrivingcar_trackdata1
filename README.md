# selfdrivingcar_trackdata1

quite a good training data from udacity simulator (track1)
tested the autonomous model on unknown track2 of udacity simulator at 10mph.
above 10mph not recommended using this data for testing on track2. but works really good at full speed on track1 on which model was trained.
